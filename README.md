# PRODIGY_DS_02
### Summary of Tasks, Problem Solving, and Learnings:

Over the course of this project, I have applied several key data science concepts, showcasing your growing expertise in **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **model building**. Here's a detailed summary of what you've accomplished:

---

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - **Problem**: The Titanic dataset contained categorical data (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) and non-numeric columns (e.g., `Name`, `Ticket`) that could not be used directly for correlation analysis or machine learning models.
   - **Solution**: 
     - **Mapped categorical variables** like `Sex` to numeric values (`male` to 0, `female` to 1) using `map()`.
     - **One-hot encoded** the `Embarked` column using `pd.get_dummies()` to create binary columns for each unique value (C, Q, S).
     - **Dropped irrelevant columns** like `Name`, `Ticket`, and `Cabin` that were not useful for analysis or modeling.
   - **Learning**: This exercise taught you how to handle non-numeric data types effectively, converting them into forms suitable for further analysis. You also learned to focus on relevant features that would provide insight into the dataset.

### 2. **Handling Missing Data**
   - **Problem**: The dataset had missing values in columns like `Fare`, `Age`, and possibly others.
   - **Solution**: 
     - You removed rows with missing values in critical columns like `Fare` using `dropna()`.
     - Alternatively, you learned to **fill missing values** with appropriate statistics like the median using `fillna()`.
   - **Learning**: This step helped you realize the importance of managing incomplete data and choosing the right imputation techniques to maintain the integrity of your analysis.

### 3. **Merging and Concatenating Multiple Files**
   - **Problem**: You had to combine multiple datasets, with some files containing the same columns (e.g., `Sex`) and some sharing common identifiers like `PassengerId`.
   - **Solution**: 
     - You successfully used **`pd.concat()`** to concatenate datasets when stacking them row-wise, and **`pd.merge()`** to combine datasets based on shared keys like `PassengerId`.
   - **Learning**: This taught you how to combine datasets effectively, ensuring data consistency and learning when to merge versus concatenate depending on the structure of your data. These are key skills for dealing with real-world datasets.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Problem**: You needed to understand relationships between variables, particularly survival rates by gender, and detect trends and patterns in the Titanic dataset.
   - **Solution**: 
     - You created **visualizations** (e.g., count plots) using `seaborn` to explore the relationship between survival rates and gender.
     - You calculated **summary statistics** and performed **correlation analysis** to explore how different features like `Age`, `Fare`, and `Sex` influenced survival.
   - **Learning**: This allowed you to uncover key patterns, such as the higher survival rate of females compared to males, and identify the most important features influencing survival. Visualization and correlation analysis are essential for gaining insights before building models.

### 5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - **Problem**: The correlation analysis required all data to be in numeric format, and string data caused errors during computation.
   - **Solution**: 
     - You converted categorical data (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) to numeric values and ensured all columns used for correlation analysis were numeric.
     - You handled missing data by either filling or removing it to avoid skewed results.
     - You used `corr()` to generate a **correlation matrix** and visualized it using **heatmaps**.
   - **Learning**: You learned the importance of converting categorical variables to numeric values for correlation analysis, and how to use correlation matrices to identify relationships between features. Visualizing the correlation helped you understand interactions between variables better.

---

### 6. **Data Visualization and Interpretation**
   - **Problem**: You needed to make your data insights more accessible and visually clear.
   - **Solution**: You used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to create visual representations like count plots, and heatmaps of the correlation matrix, which effectively summarized the relationships in the data.
   - **Learning**: You gained valuable experience in creating clear and informative visualizations, which is crucial for explaining your findings to stakeholders or for further analysis.

### Overall Learnings and Expertise Developed:
1. **Handling Real-World Data**: You successfully learned to clean, preprocess, and merge real-world datasets, ensuring they are ready for analysis. This included dealing with missing values, non-numeric data, and irrelevant columns.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: You demonstrated the ability to explore relationships between features using visualizations and statistical techniques, uncovering key insights such as survival rates by gender.

3. **Data Wrangling Skills**: Your experience in handling categorical data and transforming it into numeric format is essential for any machine learning workflow. You also learned how to merge and concatenate datasets, vital for combining different sources of information.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: You applied correlation techniques to quantify relationships between features, a crucial step in identifying which variables are most important for modeling.

5. **Visualization Expertise**: You leveraged `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to create insightful and visually appealing plots, making it easier to interpret and communicate findings effectively.
